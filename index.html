    <h1>Making songs available via Coria</h1>
    <p>This is a minimal demo of two ways to make practice material available for your choir via Coria.</p>

    <p>For both of these two ways you need to have a website of some kind and of course 
    you need to have the song or songs that you want to share in format that is supported by coria.

    The website can be very simple. This example uses github pages, which is free. But if your choir has its own
    website you should be able to use that.

    The formats that are supported by coria are musicXML and Noteworthy
    Composer format.  A popular free option to create musicXML is Musescore.
    Many musicXML files for choral music can be downloaded from the site
    cpdl.org. Noteworthy composer files can be created using the tool
    Noteworthy Composer. 

    <h2>Method 1: publishing song as web-pages</h2>
    Example: <a href="music/Matona_mia_cara.html">Matona mia cara</a>

    <h2>Method 2: linking to song files</h2>
    Example: <a href=https://coria.nl/play_from_url?url=https://github.com/willemdj/coria/blob/main/music/Lassus_Matona_mia_cara.xml&back=coria.nl">Matona mia cara</a>
